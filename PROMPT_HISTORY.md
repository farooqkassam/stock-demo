## Prompt History

### 1. Initial Project Request
**Date**: Initial conversation
**Prompt**: 
```
Context:
I want to build a UI application that connects to a free API that shows stock tickers and I want it to give me a watchlist functionality. Please see screenshot of what I am thikning to build.

My requirements
1. Use react js
2. My goal is to deploy this on AWS
3. I want the application to be responsive

Your Task:
Help me build this application from scratch. But before you write a single line of code, lets plan this together. Please make a plan file that you will use to impleemnt this feature.
```

**Response**: Created comprehensive PROJECT_PLAN.md with detailed architecture, tech stack, and implementation phases.

### 2. Enhanced Testing Strategy Request
**Date**: During planning phase
**Prompt**: 
```
I like the test strategy... but I think we should have more details on whats key to test. Can you add whas vital to build
```

**Response**: Expanded testing strategy with detailed unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, performance tests, cross-browser testing, data validation, security testing, accessibility testing, load testing, and regression testing.

### 3. Implementation Start
**Date**: After planning completion
**Prompt**: 
```
Okay... I am loving this plan... lets start implememnting. Lets use the project plan we built to implement this
```

**Response**: 
- ✅ Set up React + TypeScript + Vite project
- ✅ Installed Tailwind CSS and dependencies
- ✅ Created project structure (components, context, hooks, services, utils)
- ✅ Implemented TypeScript types and interfaces
- ✅ Built StockContext with useReducer for state management
- ✅ Created API service with Alpha Vantage integration
- ✅ Built custom hooks for stock data and local storage
- ✅ Created utility functions for formatting and calculations
- ✅ Implemented all UI components (Header, SearchBar, SummaryCards, StockCard, Watchlist)
- ✅ Applied responsive design with dark theme
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript import issues
- ✅ Created AWS deployment configuration
- ✅ Initialized Git repository and made initial commit

---

### 4. GitHub Deployment Request
**Date**: After implementation completion
**Prompt**: 
```
I like the progress you've made... lets check it in githhub
```

**Response**: 
- ✅ Pushed code to GitHub repository (https://github.com/farooqkassam/stock-demo)
- ✅ Provided AWS Amplify deployment instructions
- ✅ Verified repository setup and remote configuration

---

### 5. Prompt History Tracking Request
**Date**: Current
**Prompt**: 
```
Hey Cursor... as I give you prompts, add them to a prompt history file always. That way , I have a history of how I built this application
```

**Response**: Created this PROMPT_HISTORY.md file to track all future prompts and development interactions.

## Key Decisions Made

### Tech Stack Choices
- **React 18 + TypeScript**: For type safety and modern React features
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive design and dark theme
- **Alpha Vantage API**: Free tier with 5 requests/minute, 500 requests/day
- **AWS Amplify**: For static hosting and continuous deployment
- **Local Storage**: For watchlist persistence

### Architecture Decisions
- **Context + useReducer**: For global state management
- **Component-based structure**: Modular and reusable components
- **Custom hooks**: For API calls and local storage management
- **TypeScript interfaces**: For type safety across the application
- **Caching strategy**: To minimize API calls and respect rate limits

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Dark theme**: Matching the provided screenshot design
- **Responsive grid**: 1/2/4 columns based on screen size
- **Debounced search**: 300ms delay to avoid excessive API calls
- **Hover interactions**: Remove buttons appear on hover
- **Loading states**: Spinner and loading indicators
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures

## Development Timeline

1. **Planning Phase**: Created comprehensive project plan with testing strategy
2. **Setup Phase**: React project initialization and dependency installation
3. **Core Development**: Built all components, context, hooks, and services
4. **Styling Phase**: Applied Tailwind CSS with responsive design
5. **Integration Phase**: Connected all components and tested functionality
6. **Deployment Phase**: Git setup and AWS Amplify configuration
7. **Documentation Phase**: README and prompt history creation

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Planning First**: Creating a detailed plan before coding saved significant time
2. **TypeScript Benefits**: Type safety caught several potential bugs during development
3. **API Rate Limits**: Implementing caching was crucial for the free API tier
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS made responsiveness straightforward
5. **State Management**: Context + useReducer provided clean state management without external libraries
6. **Component Architecture**: Modular components made testing and maintenance easier

## Future Enhancements (From Plan)

- [ ] Price charts using Chart.js or Recharts
- [ ] Push notifications for price alerts
- [ ] Multiple watchlists with custom categories
- [ ] Portfolio analytics and historical performance
- [ ] Social features (share watchlists)
- [ ] Advanced filtering and sorting options
